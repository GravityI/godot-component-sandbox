Base implementation of the State design pattern with a Finite State Machine with a component-based approach and States represented as Nodes.

Setup:
	- Attach "StateMachine.tscn" to the node you wish to control.
	- Assign the parent node to the controlled_object variable in the inspector.
	- Script the different states of the object according to your needs, inheriting from the State class defined in "state.gd" (which also contains comments ).
